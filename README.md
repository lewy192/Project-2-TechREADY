## Description :

This application allows Junior developers to seek answers to hard interview questions, connect with tutors and obtain reference material to assist prior to taking interviews.  The main objective is to help provide the individual prior to having an interview with a prospective employee and to 'nail' that interview.


## Motivation :

For individuals completing a coding course entry into the job market can be daunting and at times, can hinder confidence should an individual go to an interview and fail to demonstrate clear understanding of tricky questions.  

The purpose of this application is to provide a central repository that allows individuals to add and comment on tricky interview questions, provide networking capability such as connecting users with rated tutors and provide online career resources. 

System development was driven by the following user story:

    
    AS A Graduate/Junior Developer
    I WANT to be apart of a Coding Network that focuses on nailing interviews
    SO THAT I will be better prepared for interviews, 
    reinforce personal knowledge and
    can help others with theirs.
